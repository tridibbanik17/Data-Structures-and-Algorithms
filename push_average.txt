// Write an implementation of a push_average operation for a linked implementation of a stack that
// stores numbers. The push_average operation accepts a stack as a parameter. It computes the
// average value of all the items currently in the stack and then pushes that value onto the stack. Use
// the stack implementation details shown below. You may not use any stack ADT operations for this.
// You should accomplish the operation only by accessing the items field. If there is nothing in the
// stack, push_average should raise an error

push_average():
if n = 0: raise Error
sum  0
current  head
while current != null:
sum  sum + current.item
n  Node()
n.item  sum / n
n.next  head
head  n
