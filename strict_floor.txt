# In pseudocode, write a strict_floor(a, e) function that accepts a sorted array of elements (a) and an
# element to search for (e). The strict_floor function returns the largest element found in a that is less
# than e. If there is no such element, the function should raise an error. Make your solution as time
# efficient as possible.
# Note that a could contain duplicate elements.


function strict_floor(a, e):
    if a is empty:
        raise error("Array is empty. Cannot find strict floor.")

    left = 0
    right = length of a - 1

    while left <= right:
        mid = floor((left + right) / 2)

        if a[mid] < e:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    if a[left] < e:
