## About The Project

This repository contains Java implementations of various data structures and algorithms, accompanied by pseudocode explanations. It serves as a resource for learning and understanding fundamental concepts in computer science. The project includes implementations of linked lists (singly and doubly), stacks, queues, and algorithms for sorting, searching, and expression evaluation, and the rest of the .txt files include pseudocode only.

## Architecture

The project is structured with individual Java files for each data structure and algorithm.

- **Data Structures:** `LinkedList.java`, `DoublyLinkedList.java`, `Stack.java`, `StackCopy.java`
- **Algorithms:** `BracketMatcher.java`, `PostfixEvaluator.java`, `DeleteLinkedList.java`
- **Text Files:** `.txt` files containing pseudocode and algorithm descriptions of various problems.

The Java files contain the implementations of the data structures and algorithms, while the text files provide pseudocode and explanations. The `README.md` file provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, you will need to have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher.

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk # For Debian/Ubuntu
  ```

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tridibbanik17/data-structures-and-algorithms.git
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**

    ```sh
    cd data-structures-and-algorithms
    ```

3.  **Compile the Java files:**

    ```sh
    javac *.java
    ```

4.  **Run the desired program:**

    ```sh
    java BracketMatcher
    java PostfixEvaluator
    java SinglyLinkedList
    java DoublyLinkedList
    java Stack
    java StackCopy
