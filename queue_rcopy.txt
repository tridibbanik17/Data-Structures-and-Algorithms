// Write client pseudocode for a queue_rcopy function. This function takes a queue of floating point
// values as a parameter and returns a new queue that is a copy of the original but with the order of
// the items reversed. You may only use stack and queue ADT operations to accomplish this (no extra
// arrays or lists). You may alter the contents of the original queue while copying it but when the
// operation is finished, it must be restored to its original state. Try to keep the code as compact and
// efficient as possible.
